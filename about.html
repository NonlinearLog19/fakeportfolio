                    <h3>-</h3>
                        <p>Hey, I’m an 18-year-old from the Pacific Northwest, and I’ve been in love with photography for as long as I can remember. The first time I ever picked up a camera, I was seven years old. I got to use my dad's camera. I remember I spent the entire day taking pictures of cars driving by. Something about freezing a moment in time just clicked with me, and that passion never faded. Now, I do professional photography, from portraits to landscapes, always looking for new ways to capture the world around me.</p>
                    <h3>-</h3>
                        <p>Since photography isn’t the most stable career, I decided to try out web design, and I’m currently finishing up my last quarter of college before earning my diploma. Studying web design has taught me how the other side of the internet works. Whether it’s through a camera lens or a well-designed website, I love creating things that are both beautiful and meaningful.</p>
                    <h3>-</h3>
                        <p>At the end of the day, I’m just someone who loves bringing ideas to life—whether that’s capturing the perfect shot or designing a website. If you’re looking for a photographer or a web designer, contact me and I will try and get back to you as soon as I can.</p>
